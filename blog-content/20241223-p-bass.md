## (one more) p-bass - build writeup

##### last updated: 2025-05-24

in late october 2024 I decided to build another p-bass[^1]. I also decided to document the build, which you can find below :)

### parts list

* **body:**
    * BloomDoom - P-Style Bass Body - Build Your Own
        * Style: 1962 (Classic P Bass)
        * Wood: Alder
        * Color: Ice Blue Metallic

    * https://bloomdoomguitar.com/shop/p-style-bass-body-build-your-own/
    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-12-28

the ordering process was seamless, and Dustin reached out over email shortly afterwards to double-check the neck pocket dimensions I needed. he emailed me again on 2024-12-17 to confirm my shipping address. great communication, quick turnaround time, and the body is exactly what I wanted - a ~virtually flawless nitrocellulose-lacquer-finished bass body that I can beat up when I play it. BloomDoom doesn't promise "pristine" finsihes, so there are a few small irregularities in the finish, but that's fine with me and was expected. the ice blue metallic color is incredibly pretty (as you can see below), too!

    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-11-23

I love these necks! they're the lightest aluminum bass neck I've played (I also have experience with EGC and Travis Bean Designs necks and basses, respectively), they use high-quality hardware, and they have excellent customer service. I played ~thin, jazz-style necks until I found Aluminati - their necks were, and the ordering process was, so great that I was willing to adjust to the p-bass-style neck. perfect neck for a daily driver bass. James reached out shortly after my order to let me know that my neck would ship soon, despite the fact that Asheville (where they're based) had been hit by terrible flooding on 2024-27-09. the neck arrived without issues, and it looks beautiful.

* **neck plate:**
    * BlaudezGuitars Custom Neck Plate
        * https://www.etsy.com/listing/1795175549/premium-custom-neck-plate-deep-engraved
    * ordered: 2024-11-25
    * arrived: 2024-12-09

I bought the SVG from a stock website, and then sent it to BlaudezGuitars for him to engrave on the neck plate. Ordering from him was incredibly easy, he was easy to communicate with and he finished the engraving the day I made the order. (I followed him on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/blaudezguitars/) and he posted my order on his story :) ). crazy turnaround time for an incredibly quality product, I definitely would recommend!

* **pickups:**
    * Nordstrand - NP4A 4 String Precision Bass¬Æ Pickup
        * Magnet: Alnico V (Standard)
    * https://nordstrandaudio.com/products/np4a
    * ordered: 2024-10-20
    * arrived: 2024-10-23

I ordered these pickups from [Fat Bass Tone](https://fatbasstone.com/products/nordstrand-np4a-4-string-precision-bass-pickup). The last time I ordered pickups direct from Nordstrand one of the poles on a pickup was demagnetized, and they didn't answer my email about it, so I decided to order from a supplier instead. I went with Fat Bass Tone (lol) because they have excellent [demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61qUpOCJs-w) that are helpful for comparing different pickups. I went with the NP4A 4 because I already have them on another bass and the tone is exactly what I want - it's a high-output p-bass. the angled pole pieces look cool too.

* **bridge:**
    * Babicz - BB-3548-010 - FCH-4 bass Bridge, Z-Series, 5-Hole mount
        * Finish: Chrome
    * https://www.fullcontacthardware.com/fch-z-series-4-string-bass-bridge
    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-10-24

I ordered this bridge from [Allparts](https://www.allparts.com/products/bb-3548-010-babicz-full-contact-babicz-fch-z-series-4-string-bass-bridge) because they were out of stock on the Babicz website. I've installed this bridge on one other bass and liked how easy it was to adjust, so I decided to buy another. I've found that you have to slightly change your palm muting technique with these bridges because of where the string sits in the saddle, however. similar to the other bass hardware, I also think this bridge looks cool.

* **pickguard:**
    * Warmoth - P Bass¬Æ Pickguard
        * Color/Material: Black/White/Black
        * Right/Left Handed: Right-Handed
        * Neck Pickup: P Bass¬Æ (Split)
        * Controls: Volume 1, Tone 1, Input
    * https://warmoth.com/pg-p
    * ordered: 2024-10-22
    * arrived: 2024-10-30

I initially had a tough time choosing between a white or black pickguard, but some friends helped me go with white. I think that was the right choice for this bass!

* **potentiometers:**
    * CTS - Solid Shaft
        * for tone: CTS, Audio, Solid Shaft, Resistance: 250 kOhm (609722152211)
        * for volume: CTS, Linear, Solid Shaft, Resistance: 250 kOhm (609722152235)
    * https://www.amplifiedparts.com/products/potentiometers_0?filters=1052a1055c147a1052b1758c2341a2363c1758a1759
    * ordered: 2024-10-21
    * arrived: 2024-10-25

I just like how smoothly CTS pots turn :)

* **input jack:**
    * Lumberg - 1/4" Jack - Low Profile, Mono, Open Circuit (KLBM-3)
    * https://www.amplifiedparts.com/products/14-jack-lumberg-low-profile-mono-open-circuit
    * ordered: 2024-10-21
    * arrived: 2024-10-25

I originally wanted to use a Switchcraft jack because I ~feel~ like they're more reliable for repeated plugging/unplugging but it didn't fit, so I went with a Lumberg jack instead. I use these in most of my pedals so I know they work well, I was just a ~bit more worried about the durability of the plastic in the switch after repeated plugging/unplugging, especially with the drastic temperature changes the bass could see here in Michigan. but I took the bass outside in 0 degree F weather for ~10 minutes after I was finished with assembly and the bass was fine after that, so I'm not gonna worry about it anymore ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 

* **knobs:**
    * Love My Switches - Silver Aluminum Skirt Knob - "The Cosmonaut" - 1/4" Smooth Shaft
        * 29mm
    * https://lovemyswitches.com/silver-aluminum-skirt-knob-the-cosmonaut-1-4-smooth-shaft/
    * ordered: 2024-11-23
    * arrived: 2024-12-02

I love Love My Switches, and I usually try to order pedal hardware and knobs from them. I actually ordered several different knobs for this project, but decided I liked the look of the Cosmonauts the most. 

* **wiring:**
    * 22 AWG cloth stranded copper wire

I ordered these wires from Amazon with the copper tape and some other essentials. Amazon accidentally delivered the wires and copper tape to my neighbor's house, and I had to go over to retrieve it. when I knocked on their door, a knee-high kid peeked out from behind the side window curtain for a second, and then popped out the side door with his two siblings. they gave me my package but it was opened :O - those rascals! just kidding, I wouldn't have cared if they had stolen it. I ended up hating the cloth wire so maybe it would've been better if they did!

* **copper tape:**
    * LOVIMAG copper foil tape (2inch x 33 ft) with conductive adhesive

* **strap buttons:**
    * Jim Dunlop Strap Button Set (7102)
        * https://www.jimdunlop.com/dunlop-strap-button-set/

I bought these for two reasons:

1) the color matches the rest of the metal hardware on the bass
2) they're aluminum!

* **capacitor:**
    * Panasonic - Film Capacitor - 250VDC 0.047uF 5% MPET L/S=5mm (ECQ-E2473JB)
        * https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Panasonic/ECQ-E2473JB
    * ordered: 2024-10-21
    * arrived: 2024-10-24

I usually go with Mouser for my electronic components because they ship really fast and I like the name.
