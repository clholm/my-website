## (one more) p-bass - build writeup

##### last updated: 2025-05-24

in late october 2024 I decided to build another p-bass[^1]. I also decided to document the build, which you can find below :)

### parts list

* **body:**
    * BloomDoom - P-Style Bass Body - Build Your Own
        * Style: 1962 (Classic P Bass)
        * Wood: Alder
        * Color: Ice Blue Metallic
        * Aging: Closet Clean

    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-12-28
    * the ordering process was seamless, and Dustin reached out over email shortly afterwards to double-check the neck pocket dimensions I needed. he emailed me again on 2024-12-17 to confirm my shipping address. great communication, quick turnaround time, and the body is exactly what I wanted - a ~virtually flawless nitrocellulose-lacquer-finished bass body that I can beat up when I play it. BloomDoom doesn't promise "pristine" finsihes, so there are a few small irregularities in the finish, but that's fine with me and was expected.

I began by preparing the body, ensuring it was ready for the neck. I focused on precise alignment during this initial assembly.

next, I installed the bridge and tuners. I carefully secured each component, making sure they were properly seated.

I then moved on to the wiring. I connected all the electronics, paying close attention to the solder points and signal paths.

after the electronics were complete, I installed the pickguard and control knobs. I added the final aesthetic touches to the body.

finally, I strung the bass and performed the initial setup. I adjusted the action, intonation, and pickup height to achieve optimal playability.
