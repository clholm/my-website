## (one more) p-bass - build writeup

##### last updated: 2025-05-24

in late october 2024 I decided to build another p-bass[^1]. I also decided to document the build, which you can find below :)

### parts list

* **body:**
    * BloomDoom - P-Style Bass Body - Build Your Own
        * Style: 1962 (Classic P Bass)
        * Wood: Alder
        * Color: Ice Blue Metallic

    * https://bloomdoomguitar.com/shop/p-style-bass-body-build-your-own/
    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-12-28

the ordering process was seamless, and Dustin reached out over email shortly afterwards to double-check the neck pocket dimensions I needed. he emailed me again on 2024-12-17 to confirm my shipping address. great communication, quick turnaround time, and the body is exactly what I wanted - a ~virtually flawless nitrocellulose-lacquer-finished bass body that I can beat up when I play it. BloomDoom doesn't promise "pristine" finsihes, so there are a few small irregularities in the finish, but that's fine with me and was expected. the ice blue metallic color is incredibly pretty (as you can see below), too!

    * Aluminati - 34" In-Line Aluminum Bass Neck

    * https://aluminatiguitars.com/products/in-line-aluminum-bass-neck
    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-11-23

I love these necks! they're the lightest aluminum bass neck I've played (I also have experience with EGC and Travis Bean Designs necks and basses, respectively), they use high-quality hardware, and they have excellent customer service. I played ~thin, jazz-style necks until I found Aluminati - their necks were, and the ordering process was, so great that I was willing to adjust to the p-bass-style neck. perfect neck for a daily driver bass. James reached out shortly after my order to let me know that my neck would ship soon, despite the fact that Asheville (where they're based) had been hit by terrible flooding on 2024-27-09. the neck arrived without issues, and it looks beautiful.

* **pickups:**
    * Nordstrand - NP4A 4 String Precision Bass® Pickup
        * Magnet: Alnico V (Standard)
    * https://nordstrandaudio.com/products/np4a
    * ordered: 2024-10-20
    * arrived: 2024-10-23

I ordered these pickups from: [Fat Bass Tone](https://fatbasstone.com/products/nordstrand-np4a-4-string-precision-bass-pickup). The last time I ordered pickups direct from Nordstrand one of the poles on a pickup was demagnetized, and they didn't answer my email about it, so I decided to order from a supplier instead. I went with Fat Bass Tone (lol) because they have excellent [demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61qUpOCJs-w) that are helpful for comparing different pickups. I went with the NP4A 4 because I already have them on another bass and the tone is exactly what I want - it's a high-output p-bass. the angled pole pieces look cool too. 

* **bridge:**
    * Babicz - BB-3548-010 - FCH-4 bass Bridge, Z-Series, 5-Hole mount
        * Finish: Chrome
    * https://www.fullcontacthardware.com/fch-z-series-4-string-bass-bridge
    * ordered: 2024-10-19
    * arrived: 2024-10-24

I ordered this bridge from [Allparts](https://www.allparts.com/products/bb-3548-010-babicz-full-contact-babicz-fch-z-series-4-string-bass-bridge) because they were out of stock on the Babicz website. I've installed this bridge on one other bass and liked how easy it was to adjust, so I decided to buy another. I've found that you have to slightly adjust your palm muting technique with these bridges because of where the string sits in the saddle, however. similar to the other bass hardware, I also think this bridge looks cool.

* **pickguard:**
    * Warmoth - P Bass® Pickguard
        * Color/Material: Black/White/Black
        * Right/Left Handed: Right-Handed
        * Neck Pickup: P Bass® (Split)
        * Controls: Volume 1, Tone 1, Input
    * ordered: 2024-10-22
    * arrived: 2024-10-22
* **hardware:**
    * [strap buttons, pickguard, neck plate, etc.]
    * ordered: yyyy-mm-dd
    * arrived: yyyy-mm-dd
