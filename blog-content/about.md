### about this blog

this blog is a place for me (clholm) to write about my projects and topics that interest me. I plan to put build writeups here, while descriptions of my electronic creations - bass guitar dirt pedals, mostly - can be found at the [offworld serpent devices](../osd/index.html) section of my website.
