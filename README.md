# my-website-new

My personal website written in plain HTML, JS, and CSS. Also contains the website for Offworld Serpent Devices, which is where I document my musical electronic experiments. Uses Matter.js to add gravity to the text on the screen (without a canvas!) when you press the gravity button.
