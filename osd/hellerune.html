        The Hellerune overdrive is a CD4049UBE overdrive similar to the Greedtone or Red Llama 
        overdrives. Schematic and PCB files can be found on my

        Like the pedals that inspired it, the Hellerune overdrive is an overdrive pedal that
        (hopefully, I haven't built it yet, lol) works well with bass guitar. 
        This pedal uses 4 op-amps: a non-inverting input buffer, an inverting op-amp for
        the Baxandall* tone control, another non-inverting input buffer, and then a final
        inverting op-amp for volume control and preserving the signal's phase.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        The Hellerune overdrive has two footswitches - an on/off switch and a "more" switch
        that reduces the input resistance to the CD4049UBE chip by switching resistors, thereby reducing
        the voltage drop experienced by the input signal to the CD4049UBE. I think that's how it works at least!
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Version 1 of the pedal also uses an LT1054 chip to double the supply voltage for the op-amps
        and inverter. As an extra paranoid precaution, there's a voltage divider before the voltage doubler,
        just in case I use a "9V" power supply that runs hot. I use Strymon power supplies on my board,
        but for testing pedals I'll generally use a random power brick that I stole from my dad's electronic
        junk pile, and several of those output more than the 9V indicated. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        I removed the voltage doubler chip in version 2 in case I ever want to sell some pedals to
        my friends (only for the cost of the parts, this isn't a profit-seeking venture!) and I need to
        comply with FCC regulations.
